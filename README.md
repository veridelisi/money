💵 Money Simulation Project
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts simulating money creation and banking operations.

Each file (Code01.py, Code02.py, etc.) represents a specific part of the simulation process:

Cash deposits

Bank loans

Customer payments

Reserve movements

Money supply tracking

And more...

🚀 Quick Start
1. Install required package
❗ Before running the codes, make sure you install the abcFinance package.

bash

Edit
pip install abcfinance
2. Run the scripts
Each file can be run individually:

bash
Copy
Edit
python Code01.py
Or you can modify them to run sequentially to see the full simulation.
